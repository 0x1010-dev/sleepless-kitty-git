# Sleepless Kitty

An AUR package for a custom build of [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) reverting the [feature](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/commit/849dcd424db630dcac345874d2bc3665f04276c1) to disable rendering of "suspended" windows, which might cause `kitty` to not render windows on unfocused monitors.
